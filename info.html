<p>We are currently experiencing the worst environmental crisis in human history. Mostly to blame are human-generated factors. It is not only about burning fossil fuels like coal and oil but also mining of minerals which lead besides deforestation and destruction of natural habitats to excessive carbon dioxide production. <p>
<p>Many of mining practices come from early colonialism. Colonialists saw newly occupied territories as places to use without consideration for long-term impacts. They kept exploiting local populations as labour and natural resources as raw material, at the service of early capitalist development which in many places keeps thriving till nowadays. There is no way to see current ecological catastrophe separately from such colonial practices.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most ever wanted mineral mined is gold, the symbol of wealth and status. Its principal characteristics make it highly desirable for decorative purposes and industrially. Colonial gold enriched European powers and funded the slave trade. Not many know that indigenous, African, and mixed-race miners formed the overwhelming majority of the workforce in colonial Latin America. Gold is not the rarest metal, but it's enough hard to find and extract to make it valuable. It not only makes money but also causes environmental damage through additional carbon dioxide production.</p>
<p>Even if gold is not used anymore as currency, its value rises while it becomes more and more rare due to the excessive exploitation. At the same time it becomes more and more speculated to look for gold on other planets, like Mars. Since 1958, at least part of the gold value mined each year is spent on space exploration. Needless to say that it is a very expensive business, often related to military operations. Also burning all that fuel needed to take off the rocket from the earth ground doesn't help with the rising levels of carbon dioxide on Earth. SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, while reaching orbit, emits more carbon dioxide in a few minutes than an average car would in more than two centuries … already tired of these interlinked and dark stories? </p>
<p>Cyano Automaton is here to help, or rather the main part of it: cynaobacteria. It is the first photosynthetic organisms ever, not only responsible for development of life on Earth but also standing behind toxic “blue-green algae” blooms, “spirulina” superfood and possible nutrient source for the first colonizers of Mars. Due to its complexity, it is also a perfect narrator for this complex story.</p>
<p>Cyano Automaton is a vessel that cultivates spirulina, the type of cyanobacteria. It gives voice to this species to tell a story about exploitation and space exploration, both deeply rooted in colonial mindset. Cyano Automaton uses data from the yearly budgets of NASA from 1959 to 2021 intertwined with global extraction of gold and produced in this way value and carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria inhabiting Cyano Automaton through its living cycles gives us an insight into how all these huge numbers are interrelated. It also helps us to draw a conclusion that damages caused by activities happening on the systemic level can’t be just copped with personal actions. Nobody won’t save the world by using hipster bamboo straws instead of the plastic ones for their drinks, the same as 5 liters of spirulina can’t produce enough oxygen to cope with current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. There has to be systemic change for which Cyano Automaton is calling for silently between its Tweets.
